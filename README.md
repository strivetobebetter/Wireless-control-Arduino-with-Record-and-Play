## Problem Statement
Leanobt, a Arduino based robotkit from Vietnam, is used in competition to complete various tasks to win the competition. Different competition required different task so Leanbot code need to change to match the tasks. This is a very time consuming process. Measuring the Leanbot distance and orientation then modify a small section of the code for every iteration is a tideous trial and error process. 

## Solution
Rather than doing the measurement and modify code instruction manually, bluetooth communication can be added into leanbot for data collection and send command to perform task then record the right sequences of tasks to streamline the process. As a result of this features, the trial and error process is **shorten from 2 weeks to 2 days**.
